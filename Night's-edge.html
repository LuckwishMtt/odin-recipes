        <h3>Pre-hardmode; post-skeletron; melee weapon</h3>
        <p>The Night's Edge is a broadsword capable of slashing through an area larger than it's own blade, creating afterimages in that range.</p>
        <p>It was once considered the strongest of all swords; nowadays, however, it is simply the strongest sword one can aquire before falling the Wall of Flesh.</p>
