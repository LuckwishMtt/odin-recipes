        <h3>Hardmode; ranged weapon</h3>
        <p>The Megashark is a fast firing, highly accurate minigun with a 50% chance to not consume ammo on use.</p>
        <p>It is highly sought after due to it's substancial DPS and how fast it can be made after the Wall of flesh falls.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mini Shark (purchased from the arms dealer)</li>
            <li>Illegal gun parts</li>
            <li>5 shark fins</li>
            <li>20 souls of might</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect the gun parts to the inner workings through the Mini Shark's flesh, do not worry about the cuts made in the process.</li>
            <li>Stuff it with the souls of might the same way you would do with ammo.</li>
            <li>Dice the fins and use them to fill the cuts and holes made in the first step.</li>
            <li>Leave the shark to rest in a salt water container, it is important that the container is at least 50% larger than the Mini Shark in all directions, this is to allow for the expeted growth.
            <p>(you may also place the shark in a permeable bag large enough and hang it in the sea, so long as the bag is entirely within the water)</p></li>
            <li>After six hours or so, the Megashark should be completely formed and ready for use.</li>
        </ol>
