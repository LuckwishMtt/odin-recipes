        <h3>Hardmode; magic weapon</h3>
        <p>The spirit flame is a dark oil lamp which summons purple flames to home in and explode it's targets, simulating the attacks of the desert spirits, from whom the desert spirit lamp, the main ingredient of this recipe, is acquired.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A desert spirit lamp</li>
            <li>2 forbidden fragments</li>
            <li>12 souls of night</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the lamp atop a mythril or orichalcum anvil in an enclosed room.</li>
            <li>At sundown, fill the lamp with the souls and dissolve the fragments within, be sure to close the lamp while there is still some sunlight.</li>
            <li>This next step may take anywhere from 1 to 12 hours: when the room start to boil, ready your smithing hammer, you must strike as soon as the purple flame from within the lamp becomes visible.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Fail the last step and in seconds your body will be reduced to an irrecognisable charred mound, along with anything that remained in the room.</p>
        <p>If you succed however, the Spirit Flame will be forged, imbued with the power of the sand elementals and completely under your control.</p>
